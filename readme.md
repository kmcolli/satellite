================
IBM CloudÂ® Satellite helps you deploy and run applications consistently across all on-premises, edge computing and public cloud environments from any cloud vendor. It standardizes a core set of Kubernetes, data, AI and security services to be centrally managed as a service by IBM Cloud, with full visibility across all environments through a single pane of glass. The result is greater developer productivity and development velocity.

Follow this tutorial series that will go step by step in creating a satellite location, deploying an OpenShift Cluster to the location, and deploying an application to the cluster in your new location.

As a note, this is part of the zero to cloud native tutorial series ( <https://www.zero-to-cloud-native.com>).  We have created this satellite section as a stand-alone tutorial for provisioning and deploying an IBM Cloud Satellite location.  You can combine these tutorails with all the ones you will find in zero to cloud native or just go through the satellite tutorials.
